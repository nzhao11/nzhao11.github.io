                <p>
                    JANELLE. is a self-driven, color-sensing, music-playing robot. She was built by a team of four mechanical
                    engineering students using Lego, laser-cut plywood, and the RobotC programming language.

                    I really enjoyed working on the team that built JANELLE. My main contribution was programming her behaviour.
                    It was a chance for me to see how software can be used to move hardware.
