                    I'm an engineering student with a passion for using new technologies to solve real-life problems.
                    My work experience includes internships at Bonfire (Kithener, ON), and Flipp (Toronto, ON).
                    You can read more about what I did at each of my previous internships below.

                <h2>Software Development Engineer in Test at Bonfire</h2>
                <h3>Jan. - Apr. 2020 | Kitchener, ON</h3>
                <p>
                    At Bonfire, I made a meaningful impact to the software development process by approaching 
                    feature development from a test-driven mindset. Notably, I noticed a lack of automated regression
                    tests, so I spearheaded a project to run an automated Cypress regression test suite in a nightly
                    deployment. Within 2 months, I successfully worked with developers and the DevOps Lead to have
                    automated regression tests being executed nightly. This greatly improved Bonfire's ability to catch
                    regression bugs before releasing them to production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a SaaS company, clients rely on Bonfire for the entire procurement & sourcing process. One
                    of the initiatives I began was adding a weekly code analysis to my responsibilities as an SDET.
                    At the end of every week, I used SonarQube to perform a static code analysis of all the net new
                    code. This let me keep track of uncaught bugs, security vulnerabilities, and test coverage. I would
                    then read through the analysis results and triage them for my team.
